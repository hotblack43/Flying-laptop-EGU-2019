\begin{block}{\huge{Abstract}}
\begin{itemize}
\item We study scattered-light properties of telescopic systems, on land and in space, in order to determine the best systems approach for earthshine observing systems.
\item We explore the scattered-light properties of the University of Stuttgart "Flying Laptop" satellite.
\item We compare the properties of the scattered-light halo around the lunar disk as seen from the ground and from space.
\item We suggest improvements to observing techniques in view of our findings.
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{The motivation}
Earthshine is the sunlight reflected from Earth striking the Moon and observed as reflected light. The \textbf{intensity of the earthshine is a measure of} the short-wave reflectivity of planet Earth, and is therefore an important quantity to measure - especially in terms of the \textbf{climate change} debate.
 
Accurate, precise and long-duration observing campaigns of earthshine in these years of accelerating climate change \textbf{can become vital independent records} of the state of Earth, in decades to come.

Measurement of earthshine intensity faces all the problems of classical photometry: detection sensitivity  stability is central - without it, accuracy of the observations is at stake. Precision (scatter) is also important but with modern instrumentation is at a level where averaging across data is sufficient to beat the random error down to levels where climate-change studies can be performed.

It is in the accuracy (lack of biases, and particularly, the absence of time-varying bias) that the core of the problem lies.

In this work we explore the possibility that observing earthshine from outside the atmosphere, here with the University of Stuttgart Flying Laptop MICS camera, leads to beneficial conditions - compared to traditional telescopic photometry from below the often cloudy and dynamically unstable  atmospheric layer. Dedicated earthshine satellite instruments could be built, \textbf{provided the benefits and draw-backs of satellite optical instrumentation are fully understood}.




\end{block}


            
\begin{block}{The problem}
 
Earthshine is weak and has to be measured very close to a bright source of light -- the sun-lit side of the Moon. Scattered light becomes a problem. Under the atmosphere, the light scattered from the bright side of the Moon onto the earth-lit side, by the Mie scattering in the air, has to be removed at the data-reduction stage. Light is also scattered and diffracted by optics - \textbf{how strong is typical atmospheric scattering} compared to optics-induced scattering? \textbf{Understanding that is the question of the present poster,} and our main tool for answering it is to compare images of the Moon obtained through the atmosphere, with images obtained of the Moon from space.

\end{figure}

Section about the MICS camera and its properties, with example images of ground and space objects.

On the satellite there are three cameras obtaining images in each their own filter. Each camera has its own CCD detector, and each camera has its own main multi-element objective and interior baffling.
The Multispectral Imaging Camera System (MICS) camera and its detector have the following specifications:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Objective is a 4 cm OD x-element
    \subitem coated?
    \subitem focal length x cm, f-numnber thus 4
    \item Image sensor is a Kodak KAI-1003M CCD interline sensor 
    \subitem 12-bit dynamic range
    \subitem Rolling shutter? To be confirmed!
    \subitem Bias-frame has a regular pattern due to xxx - See Figure~\ref{fig:biasfig}
    \item There are three broad-band interference filters for 530-580 nm (Green), 620-670 nm (Red), and 820-870 nm (NIR).(See Figure~\ref{fig:ripplefig}).
\end{itemize}

Mean values near 50 counts, standard deviation about x counts. from 11 to 13 images in each of the three colour-bands have been aligned and averaged. }

\begin{block}{Expectations for point-spread function profiles.}
Diffraction in optics, and most optical defects (micro-scratches in lens surfaces, for instance) produce point-spread functions (PSFs) with power-law wings. Observing any object through such a system will therefore produce images with power-law profiles. IN addition to this, scattering in the atmosphere also results in additional power-law behaviour in the resulting PSF. 

The end-result is different, however, if the object being observed is a point source (like a star), or a line (like a leaser-beam in a turbid atmosphere) or more extended objects such as semi-infinite planes or large illuminated disks (such as a full Moon).

An optical system produces  diffraction patterns around objects viewed. In mono-chromatic light, the ripples can be seen, but in broad-band light, such as with the MICS filters, the envelope of the diffraction pattern becomes that of a $1/r^3$ function.

Viewing objects with different geometries and extents with such a diffraction-PSF yields halos of scattered light around the edges of the object with profiles that depend on the geometry of the object and the distance from the edge.

For a range of geometries we find:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A point-source receives a $1/r^3$ profile
    \item A line-source receives a $1/r^2$ profile at distance from the line, and
    \item A semi-infinite half-plane receives a $1/r$ profile, while
    \item a uniform disk receives a variable profile similar to $1/r$ close to the edge and asymptotically approaching $1/r^3$ as the distance to the edge grows.
\end{itemize}

Any additional structure around an object, caused by light-scattering before the light arrives at the telescope objective - scattering in  the atmosphere for instance, or by the main objective front surface (dust or scratches) - would broaden the halo profile.

We can therefore use the measured profile of halos around objects observed by the MICS instrument to determine the dependency on distance from the object and understand whether any additional source of light scattering is present beyond that due to broad-band diffraction.

\begin{block}{Halo profiles in space images.}

Figure X shows the profile of the halo of the Full Moon images taken with the MICS that we have from the night of February 16-17 and 18 2019. The Figure contains realistic estimates of the errors we expect in setting the level of the electronics-induced background in the images, and lets us understand whether the profile significantly indicates a profile like a straight line (as expected from log-log plots of $1/r^{\alpha}$-type power laws) or not.

\textbf{Figure x.}\textit{Scattered-light halo profiles. The radial profile of the scattered light halo seen around the Full Moon disk on the nights of February 16 to 18th of 2019 were measured, in three colour filters, and are here plotted as function of the distance from the lunar disk edge. Black is the Green-filter profile, red is for the red filter, and purple is from the near-infrared image. The intensities have been scaled so at so coincide at r=10.}

\end{block}
\begin{block}{Summary}
\begin{itemize}
    \item We have  measured the halo-slope of images of the Moon from the ground and from space.
    \item We find a shallow slope in the space-based images
    \item The slope we find in the earth-based images suggest closer performance to what theory predicts for a diffraction-limited instrument observing through broad bands.
    \item The origin of the shallow slope in the images from space are unexplained, but could be due to 'Ghost images' easily formed in a short focal-length instrument.
\end{itemize}

\end{block}

\begin{block}{Recommendations}
For a space-based imaging instrument to provide data comparable or superior to the current generation of Earth-based earthshine instruments we suggest the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A 16-bit image sensor is needed
    \item Very low bias level - a.k.a. readout noise, or RON, is required
    \item A physical shutter - or a "Global Shutter" (defined in electronics) - preventing illumination of the sensor during readout, is required for short exposure times, such as these of the bright Moon.
    \item imaging without a coronograph optical design does not reduce stray light or diffraction from the aperture enough. A Lyot stop in the collimated part of the beam prior to third lens and image formation on the sensor is recommended.
\end{itemize}
